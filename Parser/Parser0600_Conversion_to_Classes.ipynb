    "# Parser 6.00 - Conversion to Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "This version does not add any new capabilties but instead begins the process of converting the parser and evaluator from stand alone functions into Python classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main motivation is that the *\\_\\_init\\_\\_()* function (method) of a class offers the attractive possibility of paying a one-time initiation cost to set up anything we might want to re-use several times during the lifetime of an instance of the class. Even if we don't use this capability right away, we'll always have the option.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main reason for doing the conversion now is that the parser and evaluator are still simple enough that the job is fairly straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional reason is that, as has already been mentioned, part of the purpose of this series is simply to learn how things work in Python in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we could convert every set of related functions we've created so far (ie., all the scaffolding functions) into classes, we'll stick to just the parser and evaluator. That should be sufficient for our purposes."

    "At present both the parser and evaluator need to know what these values are. If we want our classes to be self-contained we'd prefer not to leave them dependent on global values external to themselves. Is there another way to specify these and get rid of *Common* altogether?\n",
    "\n",
    "At first sight, the simplest approach would be to copy these values into both classes and be done with it. However if in the future these values changed, we'd have to remember to do it in both places. This is the sort of requirement that is easy to overlook. We'd have to document it somewhere (at the very least with a comment) to remind ourselves to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach would be to require only one class to know them. One idea might be to implement all range checking in a separate *Limits* class. This has the apparent drawback of needing to find a way to handle all the various checks we've already implemented. At first glance this seems more trouble than it's worth, plus in the end requiring more classes then we really want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the parser currently has only one range check, a simpler approach might be to let only the *Evaluator* class know about the limits and require the *Parser* class to use the evaluator to check if an integer conversion has gone out of range. Changes to the evaluator would be fairly minimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could also create a *Limits* base class and derive both the *Parser* and *Evaluator* classes from it, thereby incorporating its class \"constants\" into them. This has a certain appeal but also a certain inelegance about it as *Limits* itself doesn't really seem foundational.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most elegant solution would be to create only one class incorporating the range limits as instance variables and two methods, *doparse()* and *doevaluate()*. In a real world application this is probably what we would do. However for learning and expository purposes we'd prefer to keep the parser and evaluator in separate code cells.\n",

    ">It's actually possible to have one Python class split over multiple notebook cells. While Jupyter notebooks themselves have no built-in way to do this, there are some [informal methods](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45161393/jupyter-split-classes-in-multiple-cells/45161859).\n",
    "\n",
    "What we'll do here is define these and any other values needed by both the parser and evaluator in the *Parser* class. Then we'll use it as a base class to derive the *Evaluator* class. This will give the evaluator access to these values without exposing them to anything outside either class (at least in theory).\n",
    "\n",
    ">We'll define both limit values in the *Parser* class even though it doesn't need both in order to keep them together, just in case of future changes."
