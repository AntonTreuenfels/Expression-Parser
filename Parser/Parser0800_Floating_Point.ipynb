    "# Parser 8.00 - Floating Point Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this version of the parser is to have it accept [floating point numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic) in decimal and (just for fun) hexadecimal formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Digression\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital computers maintain a simple relationship between bits and integers. Except for any sign bit, each bit represents a power of two. The maximum value that can be represented is limited only by the number of bits used. Computer hardware registers have a maximum size. Since it is easier to manipulate integers that fit into a register than integers which don't, this suggests (but does not dictate) a maximum integer value supported by any given programming language on any given machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within whatever limits are supported, integer arithmetic is exact. The results of operations on any two integers is always another integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Floating point numbers are different. They recast how the bits that represent a number are interpreted to include fractional values. Most often there is also an increase in the range of numbers represented, to far beyond the limits of integer arithmetic using the same number of bits. However (and this is a big however) this is coupled with an *inescapable loss of precision*. Arithmetic operations are no longer guaranteed to result in exactly representable values.\n",
    "\n",
    "So here be dragons, notoriously difficult creatures to study but whose complex ethology has been [documented](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html) from time to time. Even without ever encountering one, a few moments of reflection should be enough to convince that they exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "The crux of the problem is this: the mathematical real numbers are continuous, so that between any two a third can be found, and they are infinite in extent, so that for any one a larger or smaller one can be found. The nature of digital computers, which handle data in discrete and finite chunks, prevents them from directly manipulating real numbers. What they *can* do is *approximate* the real numbers to whatever range and precision we are willing to spend the time and space to achieve. But it is important to remember that no digital approximation can represent more than a tiny subset of the real numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the popular [IEEE 754 double precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format) floating point standard. Numbers are represented by a 64-bit code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sign    \n",
    "  < exponent><                  mantissa                        >\n",
    " |\n",
    " SEEEEEEEEEEEMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM\n",
    " |                                                              |\n",
    "Bit 63                                                        Bit 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One bit for the mantissa sign, 11 bits for the exponent, and 52 bits for the mantissa itself. This format has a range of about 10\\*\\*-308 to 10\\*\\*308 and a precision of about 15 decimal digits.\n",
    "\n",
    ">A signed integer using the same 64 bits has a range of about 10\\*\\*-19 to 10\\*\\*19 and represents precisely every integer in that range to about 19 decimal digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The floating point mantissa actually has 53 bits. Values are stored in normalized form, ie., the mantissa is shifted to the left until the most significant bit is a one bit. The first benefit of this is that each value is guaranteed a unique representation. Second, since the most significant bit is known to be the constant one, without loss of precision it can be dropped from the actual representation and replaced by the sign bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exponent is also signed, with a range of -1022 to 1023. However it is stored as an unsigned value in the range one to 2046 by adding a bias of 1023 to its actual value. This is a computational advantage in this application (eg., exponent magnitudes are easy to compare, so in many cases it is easy to tell which of two values is larger without ever examining the mantissa).\n",
    "\n",
    "This form of representation is quite granular in its precision and has a very non-uniform density over its range. This is not specific to the IEEE 754 standard but is characteristic of any similar representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A 53-bit mantissa can exactly represent\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "2**53 = 9007199254740992\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "real numbers between any two consecutive exponent values. This is very large but hardly infinite count. It is also (by no coincidence) the same as the count of integers between 2\\*\\*53 and 2\\*\\*54. Exponent values greater than 54 cover ranges in which not even every integer can be represented. Put another way, integers in the range 2\\*\\*54 to 2\\*\\*1023 require at least 16 and on up to more than 300 decimal digits to express exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    ">It should be noted that while astronomically large numbers are quite imprecise in this representation, this is also the case for numbers of similar size in any common representation. A number expressed in [scientific notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation) rarely has as many as 15 significant digits, for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the other end of the scale, half the allowed exponent values are negative. Negative exponents always signify a value less than one. Since the mantissa can be either positive or negative, this means fully half of all the real numbers that can be exactly represented fall between minus one and one. This is true for any similar representation as it depends only on the fact that the exponent is signed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two floating point numbers are by far easiest to add or subtract if their exponents have the same value. If they don't, normally they are transparently brought into agreement by whatever software or hardware is manipulating them before attempting any arithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "However exponent alignment can also lead to a loss of precision which may go unnoticed by the user â€“ one of the dragons mentioned earlier. As one exponent is increased or reduced to match the other, its associated mantissa must be adjusted to maintain the value of the number represented. A base 10 example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "1.0 * 10**3 = 10.0 * 10**2 = 100.0 * 10**1 = 1000.0 * 10**0 = 10000.0 * 10**-1 = 100000.0 * 10**-2 = 1000000 * 10**-3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In base two the adjustment is quite simple, as it merely requires shifting the mantissa one bit left or right each time the exponent value changes by one. Knowing the mechanics makes it easy to force a precision loss:"

A precision loss can readily occur when the number of mantissa shifts required to align the exponents meets or exceeds the number of bits it has.

    "### How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we need to decide on is what floating point literals look like. In this version they will look like integer literals, except they may optionally have a radix point which itself may be optionally followed by more digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "For decimal floating point, the regular expression we use to recognize them is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "'[0-9]+([.][0-9]*)?|[.][0-9]+'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which means \"one or more digits, optionally followed by a decimal point, which can optionally be followed by zero or more digits, *OR* a decimal point followed by one or more digits\". This recognizes all of these forms as decimal floating point numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 123\n",
    "- 123.\n",
    "- 123.4\n",
    "- .456\n",
    "\n",
    "The regular expression for recognizing hexadecimal floating point numbers is essentially the same, just extended to the 16 hexadecimal digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that our original integer literals are also recognized by these expressions. If we adapt our integer conversion function (now renamed from *convertUint()* to *convertFloat()*) to handle floating points as well, we can keep using just two checks for numeric literals in the main loop instead of adding a third just for floating point. So that's what we do.\n",
    "\n",
    "In *convertFloat()* we use the string method *partition()* to separate the integer and fractional portions of the input literal at the radix point (we also take the opportunity to uppercase any hexadecimal digits).\n",
    "\n",
    ">We prefer *partition()* to *split()* because the former has well-defined behavior if the input literal doesn't actually contain a radix point. What *split()* does in that case is not well-documented.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is no radix point, the entire input literal will be in *lint* and *lfrc* will be null. The same will be true if there are no digits following the radix point. If there are, then both *lint* and *lfrc* will be non-null. Finally, if the input literal begins with a radix point, *lint* will be null and *lfrc* will not be.\n",
    "\n",
    ">In no case do we actually care about the radix point itself, so we conventionally assign it to the *_* variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversion of any integer portion of the input literal proceeds exactly as it did in previous versions. Conversion of the fractional portion is similar, but here we divide each successive digit by a larger and larger value to reflect its decreasing significance.\n",
    "\n",
    ">We don't need to check for overflow during this step because the value of the fractional part will always be between zero and one. Underflow, on the other hand, is quite possible. As the divisor grows, eventually each successive digit will have a value after the division indistinguishable from zero because of the way floating point arithmetic works.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final value after conversion is simply the sum of the integer and fractional portions. We make one final check. If the value of the integer portion is anything other than *_FLTMAX*, no value of the fractional portion can make the sum of the two exceed *_FLTMAX*. However if it is *_FLTMAX*, any non-zero value of the fractional part will cause overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Of course a major advantage of a floating point representation is that it increases the range of represented numbers beyond that of simple integers. So why limit them to the same range here? Mostly because what we're really interested in here is simply how to recognize and convert them. Also because leaving them as they are still serves our range checking purposes. We do rename the limits from *_INT---* to *_FLT---*, though."

The tests are straightforward and quite similar in form to the multiplication checks, including the reversal of the inequality direction when *rgt* is negative. We also now allow the return value to be non-integer."
