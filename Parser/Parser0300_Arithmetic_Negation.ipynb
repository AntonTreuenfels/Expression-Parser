    "# Parser 3.00 - Arithmetic Negation\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal for this version of the parser is to be able to recognize arithmetic negation.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the surface this may not seem an obvious next step. That might instead seem to be subtraction, but in fact the ability to create a negative number by means other than subtraction is necessary in order to thoroughly test subtraction. Without this ability the equal precedence of subtraction and addition would prevent us from ever creating two different negative numbers in the same expression (try it). So we could never subtract a negative from a negative, and our tests would be incomplete.\n",
    "\n",
    ">We could instead introduce grouping parentheses at this point to alter the order of evaluation. This would allow us to create two different negative numbers by indirect means, also solving the problem. However it seems to make more sense to introduce negative numbers first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why introduce a negation operator instead of making the parser capable of directly recognizing negative literal values? Mainly because eventually we will want to apply negation to variables as well as literals, so it seems a more general solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four characteristics of the unary negation operator **'-'** that we need to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- it is [unary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_operation)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- it is prefix\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- it is [right associative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_associativity)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- it has a [higher precedence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations) than binary addition\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic negation happens to a single operand, and the operator appears before the operand (as opposed to appearing after the operand, or as a suffix). Right association requires that when two or more negation operators are applied to the same operand, they are performed right to left. Higher precedence means that if both our operators are applied to the same operand, negation happens before addition.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The idea that a computer programming language should interpret mathematical expressions the same way we all learned in grade school is common but not universal. [APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)), [Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)) and [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)) are some of the languages which evaluate expressions using rules which do not include operator precedence. However we will not go down that path here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we are going to have two operators of unequal precedence, we need a way to parse expressions that might contain any combination of them. For this we will adopt (and eventually adapt) [Dijkstra’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra) [Shunting Yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm) for converting [infix expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation) to [postfix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Postfix is also commonly known as Reverse Polish notation (RPN). The advantage of RPN expressions is that they are easy to evaluate, left to right, with no ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why the Shunting Yard? Mainly because it made immediate sense to me when I first encountered it, which is not an experience I’ve had with [other parsing algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_parsing).\n"

    "Previously we had no need to specify a lower limit for our integers. It was simply implied to be zero, as there was no way to create any smaller value. By adding signed integer values we perforce need to add a lower limit on them in order to play with out of range arithmetic results.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a slight problem in that tests already written used unsigned 32-bit values. Every bit is interpreted as a power of two. In particular, the most significant bit is interpreted as a magnitude just like all the other bits (zero if zero, 2\\*\\*31 if one).\n",

It's a hardware limit, not a software one. Because we are interested in limits only so we can test them, we can simply use what are effectively 33-bit integer values. We rename *uintMax* to *intMax*, making our maximum postive value 2\\*\\*32-1. We introduce a minimum negative integer value of -2\\*\\*32.\n",

That is, negating them by flipping all **M** bits, adding one, and truncating to **M** bits results in their original values.\n",

We would expect that the result would be *intMax+1*, which is not possible to represent (we are pretending). We could simply ignore what happens and let the user deal with problem. Here we choose to make it illegal to negate *intMin*."

    "### How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "We implement all of the basic mechanics of the Shunting Yard algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parser relies on the use of a [stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)) and its two fundamental operations of pushing and popping. Here it essentially functions as a holding area for operators we find in the infix expression. Once pushed on the stack, operators stay there until popped off.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the *wantoperand* state, if we find an integer literal we immediately add it to the RPN expression we're building up. Then we switch to the *wantoperator* state.\n",
    "\n",
    "If instead we find a negation operator, we push it. But first we pop off any higher precedence operators already on the stack and add them the RPN expression. Then we push the negation operator on the stack. We do not change the state, which allows us to write two or more negation operators in a row if we like.\n",
    "\n",
    ">In this version such multiple negations can be written without separating the operators. However when the predecrement operator **'--'** is introduced, it will become necessary to put one or more spaces between them to guarantee multiple negation is what happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "We initialize the operator stack with an *End of Expression* operator which has the lowest precedence of all. This acts as a backstop, making sure that we will always find a lower precedence operator.\n",
    "\n",
    ">This operator never appears in either the original infix expression or the final RPN result. It is therefore sometimes called an *imaginary* operator. In a sense the only reason it's called an operator at all is that it appears on the operator stack. It doesn't actually have any effect on any operand.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the *wantoperator* state we're still only looking for addition operators. First we switch states, because it's what we need to do if successful and it doesn't matter if we're not. If we are successful we do almost the same as for negation operators, except this time we pop operators with a greater or equal precedence.\n",
    "\n",
    ">In the Shunting Yard algorithm, right associative operators like negation pop only higher precedence operators. Left associative operators like addition pop both higher and equal precedence operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once there is no more expression to parse, we use a very low precedence to pop any operators still on the stack into the RPN. This is on purpose lower than that of any operator that can appear in the RPN, but still higher than the *End of Expression* operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since operator precedence parsing relies only on relative values (higher precedences have higher values), their actual values are somewhat arbitrary. Here we are using values that leave room for adding operators with other precedences as we go along."

    "### How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluator also relies on the use of a stack. Unlike the parser, this stack holds operands. Operators pop one or two off, evaluate them, and push the result back on the stack. This continues until there is no more RPN to process. At this point there is only item on the stack, the final result\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not need to explicitly check that things work out this way. A successful parse guarantees that the expression is properly formed, and a properly formed expression *will* work out this way. Of course it is possible to feed the evaluator deliberately malformed input, but we will not be doing that here and so will not guard against it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Execution of binary operators pull operands off the stack in reverse of the order they were pushed on, hence the right-hand operand comes off first. This is not so important for addition, which is commutative, but it will be for operators which are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity we perform both a range check of the result and also the addition. This lets us use the single function *inRange()* to both check the result and update the operand stack. If the result is out of range, we discard the result and report an error.\n",
    "\n",
    ">We could push the result in any case, since the whole stack is going to be discarded after an error anyway. This is a matter of preference; either way works just fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The introduction of signed values and a minimum allowed negative integer means that range checking becomes more complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four possible combinations of operand signs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. positive + positive: greater than *intMax* possible\n",
    "2. positive + negative: out of range not possible\n",
    "3. negative + positive: out of range not possible\n",
    "4. negative + negative: less than *intMin* possible\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these combinations we might write a range check like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# lft and rgt positive ?\n",
    "# - req: lft + rgt <= intMax\n",
    "\n",
    "if lft >= 0 and rgt >= 0:\n",
    "    ok = rgt <= intMax - lft          # re-arranged to avoid overflow\n",
    "\n",
    "# lft and rgt negative ?\n",
    "# req: lft + rgt >= intMin\n",
    "\n",
    "elif lft < 0 and rgt < 0:\n",
    "    ok = rgt >= intMin - lft          # re-arranged to avoid underflow\n",
    "\n",
    "# signs differ - no out of range possible\n",
    "\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    ok = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above code has the apparent advantage that a check is performed only in cases where out of range results are actually possible. So why does the code in the evaluation loop always perform a check? It always gives the same result, but is it actually an improvement?\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe. We note that despite any [short circuit evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation) of [Python's](https://www.python.org/) **and** logical-AND operator, the version above always performs at least three comparisons even when no check is ultimately made. If a check is made, there are four comparisons and one subtraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The version used always makes two comparisons and one subtraction. If the cost of comparison and subtraction are similar – and they should be, since at the hardware level a comparison is just a subtraction with the result value discarded – then overall the second version should be faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does the function call in the version used make a difference to this analysis? No, because we would also make that same call if we used the above version, and for the same reason (to centralize and simplify range checking and stack pushing).\n"
