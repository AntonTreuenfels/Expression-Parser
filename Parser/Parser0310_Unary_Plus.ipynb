    "# Parser 3.10 - Unary Plus\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal for this version of the parser is to be able to recognize the unary plus operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "There may be some question about what a unary plus operator should actually *do*. One possibility is for it to act as an *abs()* function, making negative values positive and leaving positive values alone. This would have the same inability to convert *intMin* to a positive value that arithmetic negation does, but we could handle that the same way we do for arithmetic negation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other choices include having unary plus force the 'usual arithmetic conversions' (as in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) \\), convert strings representing numbers to numeric values but leave numeric values unchanged (as in [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)), or simply be available as a placeholder for later definition in languages that support [operator overloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_overloading) (as in [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since later we plan to use *abs()* as an example of a one-argument function, we'll make the simplest possible choice and define unary plus to be a null operator that does not do anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually we are more interested here in something else: because we already use the **'+'** character for binary addition, we'll need some way to distinguish between its unary and binary meanings in our parser and evaluator.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of what PJ Brown in his book [Writing Interactive Compilers and Interpreters](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Interactive-Compilers-Interpreters-Computing/dp/0471100722) calls a *polymorphic operator*. This has not become a common term since the book was published, but I find it quite useful to mean symbols which can represent more than one operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphic operators are not uncommon in programming languages. In [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) the symbol **‘+’** is used for both arithmetic addition and string concatenation, and the **‘=’** symbol for both variable assignment and equality comparison. In [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) the **‘\\*’** symbol is used for both arithmetic multiplication and [pointer dereferencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dereference_operator), and the **‘&’** symbol for both [bitwise AND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND) and taking the address of a variable or function (eg., to initialize a pointer). Both BASIC and C use the **‘-‘** symbol to mean arithmetic negation as well as arithmetic subtraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative to polymorphic operators is to use different symbols for different operations. Some versions of BASIC use **‘+’** for arithmetic addition and **'&’** for string concatenation. [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)) uses **‘:=’** for variable assignment and **‘=’** for equality comparison. C uses **‘=’** for variable assignment and **‘==’** for equality comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unique operators for different operations are in many ways helpful for parsing. On the other hand, there are only so many symbols in the [ASCII character set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) (a subset of [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)). The more operators a computer language supports, the harder it is to come up with unique representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole point of Reverse Polish notation is that there is absolutely no ambiguity about what to do. Every operator must be unique so no decision is necessary to determine how to handle it. Operators which are polymorphic in the original infix must be made unique in the Reverse Polish.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only real consideration is that however this is done, the distinction between operands and operators is maintained. The evaluator – or whatever else might handle the finished Reverse Polish – has to be able to tell the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a simple decorating scheme by prefixing each unary operator with the letter *U*. Anything that starts with a letter cannot be a number, and so cannot be mistaken for a numeric operand. The Reverse Polish form of unary plus will be *U+* while that of arithmetic negation will be *U-*.\n",
    "\n",
    ">At this point we don't actually need to distinguish the arithmetic negation operator from anything else, but it won’t hurt to do so."
