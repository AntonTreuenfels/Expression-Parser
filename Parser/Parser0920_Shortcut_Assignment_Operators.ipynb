    "# Parser 9.20 - Shortcut Assignment Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this version of the parser is to teach it to recognize shortcut assignment operators. That is, operators which perform an arithmetic operation using the value of the variable which appears their left side and the value of the expression on their right before assigning the final result to the variable on their left.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason they are called shortcuts is because they eliminate the need to specify the variable on both sides of the assignment. For example, both of these expressions add one to the value of **a**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "a = a + 1\n",
    "a += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Though they have the same effect, the parsed Reverse Polish differs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "a = a + 1 => A A U* 1 B+ B=\n",
    "a += 1    => A 1 B+=\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The more compact shortcut assignment may also execute faster, since there is less overhead in the evaluation loop. In the end it still has to do everything the more verbose version does, but it can do so implicitly instead of explicitly."

    "### How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "In theory changes to the parser should be confined to its initialization:\n",
    "\n",
    "- extend the recognition of assignment operators to include four new shortcut assignments\n",
    "- add their precedences to the precedence dictionary\n",
    "- add their type check information to the type index dictionary\n",
    "- and that's it\n",
    "\n",
    "Alas, if only it were that easy! Doing this the most straightforward way suggests right associative binary operators could be recognized by a simple regular expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "'[-+*/]?='\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This basically means \"an equals sign, optionally preceeded by one of four arithmetic operators\". So it should match any of:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "= *= /= += -=\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "...and it does. No problem there. However up to now left associative binary operators have been checked first. This picks off all the arithmetic operator prefixes of **'='**, since they are single character matches. Then the parser switches state and complains that the following **'='** sign is not an operand.\n",
    "\n",
    ">You might expect that the matching engine in Python's regular expression library would search for the longest possible match, and avoid single character matches when two character matches are possible. Which is what other regex engines routinely do by default. But you'd be wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hmm. What if we reverse the order of checks so that right associative binary operators come first? Now our shortcut assignments work fine but we soon notice that our regex for them also matches\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "==\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "...but only the first **'='**. Then as before the parser complains that the second **'='** is not an operand.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Regression testing. Useful but sometimes annoying.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to keep our current arrangement of separate checks for left- and right-associative operators, we're going to have to find a way to express the idea of matching either \"one but not two equal signs\" or \"an arithmetic operator *not* followed by an equal sign\".\n",
    "\n",
    ">The bright side of this approach is it allows us to extend our knowledge of Python regular expressions to include [lookaround assertions](https://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html)! \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the first possibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "'[-+*/]=|(?<![=!])=(?![=])' \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This regex matches all our assignment operators without also matching **'=='**. Left of the **'|'**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "'[-+*/]='\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "matches any of our four shortcut assignment operators. Right of the **'|'**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "'(?<![=])=(?![=])'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "matches **'='** but not **'=='**. It works by using *negative assertions* (note the **'!'** negation operator).\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "'(?<!...)'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "is a *negative lookbehind assertion*. It matches if what follows it matches and is not preceded by whatever **'...'** matches. Since in our case we've used a character class consisting only of an **'='** sign, this matches if the **'='** following it is not preceded by another **'='**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "'(?!...)'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "is a *negative lookahead assertion*. It matches if whatever precedes it is not followed by whatever **'...'** matches. In our case, we've specified that we do not want an **'='** sign to follow another **'='** sign.\n",
    "\n",
    ">This is actually a general solution to the problem of matching one character but not two of them in a row. Just replace **'='** with whatever character should appear only once.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not the easiest regex to understand at first sight, but it does work in our regression tests if we check for right associative operators first.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about the other idea?\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "'[-+*/](?![=])|==|!='\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This uses only one negative assertion to match an arithmetic operator that is *not* followed by an **'='** sign. This also passes all our regression tests if we check for left associative operators first.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are somewhat ugly solutions, though. Either regex is complicated by what is essentially special case checking. This may become even more of a nuisance as more operators are added. So instead we'll do something else that attempts to preserve more of the simplicity we're looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by discarding the idea of separately checking for left- and right-associative binary infix operators. The reason we've been doing so to this point is because we have to treat them differently once we've found them. But we can accomplish that purpose another way.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a dictionary indexed by operator to hold everything we need to know about that operator - its precedence, associativity and type checks. This in itself is a simplification of what we've been doing so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could put a flag in the dictionary to indicate left- or right-associativity. That would work; we'd call *pushLeft()* or *pushRight()* with the operator and its precedence depending on the flag. The code might even be a little cute:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "if startsWith(_binOps):\n",
    "    '''binary operator?'''\n",
    "    prec, assoc, check = _binOp[token]\n",
    "    ok = pushLeft('B'+token, prec, check) if assoc == 'Left' else pushRight('B'+token, prec, check)\n",
    "```       \n",
    "   \n",
    "However we can also put the *pushLeft()* and *pushRight()* functions into the dictionary directly and call them indirectly. Which seems even cuter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "if startsWith(_binOps):\n",
    "    '''binary operator?'''\n",
    "    prec, assoc, check = _binOp[token]\n",
    "    ok = assoc('B'+token, prec, check)\n",
    "```       \n",
    "\n",
    ">We have extended *pushLeft()* and *pushRight()* to accept and save an operator's type check information on the operator stack. Plus we create a similar dictionary for unary operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only hitch in this approach is exactly the same one we've encountered before in the evaluator: the problem of forward reference to the functions we want to call indirectly. Here those functions are nested within *doparse()*, where initialization of a *Parser* object cannot \"see\" them. We solve it the same way, by moving the new dictionaries inside *doparse()* and placing them after the definitions of the functions we'll call indirectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now need only relatively compact regexes to specify all the operators we currently recognize. Since they do not contain any forward references they could be placed outside *doparse()*, but they're easier to understand when near the operator dictionaries."

    "### How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "We add four new binary operators to *binDispatch{}'*. The functions which implement them are all so similar, differing only in which specific arithmetic operation they perform, that we use *binShortVal()*  to actually do the work. We pass the name of the function that performs that operation as a parameter along with the variable name and the value of the right side of the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside *binShortVal()* we leverage existing functions we already have. This leads to some small inefficiencies, most notably in the call to *unVal()* to retrieve the value of the left side variable. The actual value is left on the operand stack (which is not really where we want it) and the return value is always **True** (which we don't care about). So we have to pop the value off the stack in order to pass it to the relevant arithmetic function.\n",
    "\n",
    ">If we instead re-implemented the part of *unVal()* that retrieves the value within *binShortVal()* itself, we could avoid any intermediate use of the operand stack. Overall the function size would increase and it would execute slightly faster. However if any changes were ever made to how *unVal()* looks up values, we'd have to remember to make them in *binShortVal()* as well. Just the sort of thing which is easy to overlook and leads to bugs that may be difficult to track down.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do we gain in exchange for these inefficiencies? Two things: smaller code size, and more importantly, the error checks already built into the leveraged functions."
