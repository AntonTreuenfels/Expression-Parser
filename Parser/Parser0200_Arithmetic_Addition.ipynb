    "# Parser 2.00 - Arithmetic Addition Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this version is for the parser to accept and evaluate [infix expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation) consisting of only decimal and hexadecimal numeric values and the [binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operation) arithmetic addition operator **‘+’**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For such a limited aim the code changes are surprisingly extensive. There is also a new facility for tracing parsing and evaluation. This is not necessary for proper operation of the parser or evaluator but can be helpful in understanding what happens (or sadly, doesn’t).\n",
    "\n",
    "Infix expressions like\n",

    "\n",
    "- they start and end with a number\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- they have a ‘+’ symbol between each pair of numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "These may seem so obvious as to not be worth mentioning, but the strictly alternating pattern of numbers (operands) and **‘+’** signs (operators) allows us to design the parser as a simple [state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine). In this case quite simple, as there will be only two states: *expecting operand* and *expecting operator*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use the state concept to decide if an expression is properly formed. The initial state is always *expecting operand*, and if we do not find one the expression is malformed. When a legal expression has been completely parsed the final state is always *expecting operator*, because the last thing that can be legally accepted is an operand. So if the final state is *expecting operand*, the expression is malformed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that by these rules a single operand by itself is properly formed, so everything that we have done up to this point still works."

    "### How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is to loop through the input expression. We use *startsWith()* to see if we can match something we're looking for. If we can, we \"chop it off\", shortening the expression we are parsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- whitespace between tokens is ignored\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- operands are converted into internal form and saved to a list\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- operators are ignored\n",
    "\n",
    ">Because there is only one operator it can simply and safely be implied in the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we cannot make any match, or if a conversion overflow occurs, we have to report an error. This is centralized in *parseErr()*, using variable values we have been tracking specifically for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    ">It's not enough simply to report an error occurred. We want to give the user a fighting chance to figure out what happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "The loop is broken when we run out of expression (everything has been chopped off) or encounter an error. We make one last check to see if we're in the proper state. Then we return our success/fail flag and any result.\n",
    "\n",
    ">We could also have pre-compiled the regular expression we use, thereby giving us access to some additonal functions that in some respects would make the parser on the whole simpler. The main reason we didn't is that we then couldn't keep the parser completely self-contained in one function. In a production version we might very well use a class to get around this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the character **'+'** used to signify addition is also used as [metacharacter](https://www.regular-expressions.info/characters.html) in regular expressions, we have to somehow indicate that we want the literal meaning and not its metacharacter meaning. A [character class](https://www.regular-expressions.info/charclass.html) with only one member is a handy way to do this, as most characters have no meta meaning when part of a class."
