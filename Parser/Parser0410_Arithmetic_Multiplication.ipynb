    "### How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "In the *wantoperator* state, we add a check for the **'\\*'** character which indicates multiplication. This is a separate check because the operator has a higher precedence than addition or subtraction. However multiplication has a lower precedence than negation, so we give it a precedence value between those two.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Another way to organize this is to group all binary operators together in one regular expression so we only make one check. If we find one, then use the actual token found as an index into a table of precedence values.\n",
    "\n",
    ">In Python we can use a [dictionary](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries) to accomplish this. The process might look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "precedenceOf = dict([('-', 60), ('+', 60), ('*', 70)])    # initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "if startsWith( '[-+*]' ):\n",
    "    pushLeft( 'B' + token, precedenceOf[token] )          # 'wantoperator' state\n",
    "```  \n",
    "               \n",
    ">This arrangement becomes more and more attractive as the number of operators we want to recognize increases, because the code in the main loop is less cluttered and easier to read. A drawback is that the precedence table has to be initialized, and as the number of operators increases that process can be made just as cluttered as the mess we're trying to get away from in the main loop.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Nevertheless we will eventually adopt something similar to this strategy."

    "# How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, multiplication of two **M** bit numbers can yield a result up to **2 \\* M** bits long. If we consider anything over **M** bits to be overflow, then there are more pairs of integers than can cause overflow than pairs which do not.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Basically any two numbers whose most significant one bit positions add up to more than **M**. For example, 65,636 (2\\*\\*16) and 131,072 (2\\*\\*17) are both much less than 4,294,967,296 (2\\*\\*32). But multiply them together and the result is 8,589,934,592 (2\\*\\*33), overflowing a 32-bit value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those who worry about multiplication overflow are typically offered two pieces of advice:\n",
    "\n",
    "- do the multiplication in a larger type\n",
    "- do the multiplication in assembly language.\n",
    "\n",
    "This after-the-fact approach of the first suggestion doesn’t work if there is no larger type to convert into. Though if we were not committed to a before-the-fact approach we could easily implement it here. Python 3's infinite precision integers allow any size result, after which we could compare to our artificial limit at leisure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other languages we'd still be mostly safe because the underlying [floating point arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic) of most high level languages actually is [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) double precision, if only because most current processers have built-in hardware support for it. Casting a float (24 bits precision) to a double (53 bits precision) before multiplying would guarantee we could always check that the result does not exceed 48 bits. We would not be perfectly safe though, since the 33-bit precision of our numbers could potentially create 66-bit results. So we won’t be doing that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second recommendation takes advantage of the fact that the arithmetic-logical unit of almost all hardware processors can signal that a result has overflowed, ie., has more bits than a hardware register can hold. This information is easy to get at in the processor's assembly language, but almost no high level language has an ability to access it. As Python is one of those languages, we won’t be doing that either.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we will do is try to detect the possibility of multiplication overflow before it happens. As before, we’ll begin with the four operand sign combinations to get an idea of what we’re up against:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. positive * positive: greater than *intMax* possible\n",
    "2. positive * negative: less than *intMin* possible\n",
    "3. negative * positive: less than *intMin* possible\n",
    "4. negative * negative: greater than *intMax* possible\n",
    "\n",
    "The straightforward way to test for pending overflow is to divide whatever the limit is by one of the operands. We choose the left operand. While by appearances it might seem we could get away with only two tests, unfortunately that is not so.  Because of the algebraic rule that dividing or multiplying an inequality by a negative number requires that the sense of the inequality be reversed, we need four different tests.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Actually five tests, since we also have to check that *lft* is not zero. As long as we must do that, it seems cleaner to check *rgt* at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps there are faster ways to check for pending overflow. There is still no denying that making any checks at all increases the overall execution time. Which may explain why overflow checks are so rarely encountered in production code. Checking takes time, and there are those who consider a fast result better than an accurate one.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s often possible to get away with this. Sometimes overflow happens but leads to nothing more serious than a [game abruptly ending](https://www.mentalfloss.com/uk/games/31376/why-does-donkey-kong-break-on-level-22). Other times it might be the root cause of an expensive [rocket launch failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_%28spacecraft%29)."
