    "# Parser 1.00 - Unsigned Decimal Integer Literals\n",
    "\n",
    "The first goal of the parser is to have it accept unsigned decimal integer literals. That is, strings of characters consisting of one or more of the digits '0' to '9'. If such string is recognized, then convert it to internal binary form. This is usually (but not always) some form of [two's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is true that Python will happily [covert decimal literals expressed as strings into its internal form](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/functions.html?highlight=int#int) without any fuss at all. As a learning exercise we're simply going to ignore that inconvenient fact in favor of doing the job manually.\n",

    "### How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "The regular expression used here simply means *a string consisting of one or more decimal characters*. Any other character included in the string causes the input string to be rejected as erroneous (in particular, any leading or trailing spaces).\n",
    "\n",
    "The nested conversion function uses a fairly simple algorithm. Set the current value to zero. Beginning at the first character of the input string and for each character thereafter, extract it, multiply the current value by 10 (because this is a decimal value, each digit represents a power of 10) and add the value represented by the current digit character.\n",
    "\n",
    "A slight complication arises because decimal digit *characters* are not the same as decimal digit *values*.  In the [ASCII character set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII), for example, the character ‘0’ is the 49th member and has a value of 48 (starting from zero). Put another way, if the bit pattern in a computer memory cell is interpreted as an ASCII character to display, a value of 48 in that cell will cause a picture (or *glyph*) of the character ‘0’ to be shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert from character value to decimal value we use the *find()* string method. We've arranged the string to be searched so that each decimal digit appears at the index which represents its value. We don't need to worry that *find()* will return -1, indicating that no match with the current digit character occurred, since we already ruled that possibility out at the top level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another complication arises from the possibility of overflow. As the input string is allowed to be any length, it is conceivable that as a string it represents a value larger than can be represented internally. Since there are an infinite number of integers but digital computers are finite, every one must have some limit on how large an integer it can programmed to handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parser has this limit set artificially low, to a little over four billion (4,294,967,295). This is the value stored in the variable *uintMax* (unsigned integer Maximum). It is much less than Python’s real upper limit, but is a convenient value for studying the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    ">For most programming languages, anyway. Python 3 is actually unusual in that it has no explicitly defined maximum integer. In theory integers are allowed to grow with unlimited precision. In practice there must always be some hardware limit beyond which there is simply no more room to store a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overflow during conversion occurs if the result of multiplying the current value by 10 and adding a new digit exceeds the maximum representable value:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "uint * 10 + digval > uintMax\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But this cannot be checked after performing the operations. The very definition of “maximum representable value” means that it is not possible to represent a larger value. Whatever the result of an overflow condition actually is, it is not larger than *uintMax*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice what happens most often in cases of overflow is *wrapping*. If the largest representable value has **M** bits (where at present **M** is typically 32 or 64), results of addition can have at most **M + 1** bits and results of multiplication **2 * M** bits. Wrapping occurs if the result of every arithmetic operation is truncated to at most **M** bits, which can always be represented. Another way to look at it is that computer arithmetic is often modular.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the truncation happens silently (as it most often does), the inequality above cannot help to detect overflow. Because under conventional precedence rules the comparison operator has the lowest priority in the expression, by the time it is executed any wrapping involved has already occurred. Thus the value to its left is always less than or equal to the representable maximum on its right.\n",
    "\n",
    "All is not lost. The inequality can be re-arranged to the equivalent form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "uint > (unintMax - digval) / 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is clear the right hand side must always be less than *unintMax*, and so can never overflow. This is still not much help if *uint*  has already overflowed, but suppose we apply the test *before* attempting to add the next digit rather than after? At that point *uint* is also always less then *uintMax*. If the test condition is false, the result of multiplying the current value by 10 and adding the next digit will always be less than or equal to *unintMax*. If the condition is true, the result would overflow the largest representable value.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is really detected here is not that overflow has occurred, but that it is *about* to occur. Which is quite often the best way to handle the problem from the point of view of computer arithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the parser the condition of the overflow test is reversed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "uint <= (unintMax - digval) / 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Written this way a true result rather than a false one allows us to safely add the next digit to the accumulating result. This enables us to put the shorter branch closest to the test in the source code, which is often the most readable way to arrange things.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shorter branch also happens to be the most often executed – the longer branch will execute at most once – and there is sometimes a (very) slight speed advantage to placing the most often executed branch closest to the test. If there is any advantage, it derives from the specific way the underlying hardware handles conditional tests and control flow changes based on them. In most cases it’s better to focus on readability."
